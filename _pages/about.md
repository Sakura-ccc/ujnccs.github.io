<br/>

I am an assistant professor at [University of Jinan](http://www.ujn.edu.cn/en/), and also a postdoctoral researcher hosted by [Prof. Yan Huang](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/yh33/) at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.iu.edu). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Shandong University](http://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2016. My advisor is [Prof. Qiuliang Xu](http://isec.sdu.edu.cn/).

My research interests include information security, data privacy, and applied cryptography. Recently, I am focusing on practical secure two-party computation, privacy-preserving machine learning, and privacy-preserving genomic data analysis.

<span style="color:red;">I am looking for highly motivated graduate students to join us on exciting information security projects! Please feel free to email your CV, Transcripts, and Publications to ist.ujn(AT)gmail.com for CSC scholarship and UJN scholarship opportunities. </span>
