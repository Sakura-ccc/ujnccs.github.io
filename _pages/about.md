<span style="color:red;">I am looking for highly motivated graduate students to join us on exciting information security projects! Please feel free to email your CV, Transcripts, and Publications (if any) to ist.ujn@gmail.com for opportunities.</span>

I am an assistant professor at University of Jinan, and also a postdoctoral researcher hosted by Prof. Yan Huang at Indiana University Bloomington. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Shandong University. My advisor is Prof. Qiuliang Xu.

My research interests include network security, information privacy and applied cryptography. Recently, I am focusing on practical secure two-party computation, privacy-preserving machine learning, and privacy-preserving genomic data analysis.
