I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Shandong University](http://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2016. My advisor is Prof. Qiuliang Xu.

My research interests include information security and applied cryptography. Recently, I am focusing on practical secure two-party computation, privacy-preserving machine learning, and privacy-preserving genomic data analysis.
