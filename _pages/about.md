<br/>

Associate professor at [University of Jinan](http://www.ujn.edu.cn/en/), and currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu).

My research interests include information security, data privacy, and applied cryptography. Recently, I am focusing on practical secure two-party computation, privacy-preserving machine learning, and privacy-preserving genomic data analysis.

<span style="color:red;">I am looking for highly motivated graduate students to join us on exciting information security projects! Please feel free to email your CV, TRANSCRIPTS, and PUBLICATIONS to ist.ujn(AT)gmail.com for CSC scholarship and UJN scholarship opportunities. </span>
